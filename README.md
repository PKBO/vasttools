# Vast.ai Server Tools (`vasttools`)

This repository contains several scripts to assist with managing GPU servers on platforms like Vast.ai. Each script focuses on a specific task such as safe OS upgrade, Docker cleanup, or fast reboot with GPU reinitialization.

---

## ðŸ”„ Server Update Script (`update_machine.sh`)

This script safely updates Ubuntu-based servers running Docker and Vast.ai services.

### What the script does

- Stops Docker and Vast.ai services safely
- Displays Machine ID (recommended to back up)
- Updates package lists
- Upgrades packages
- Disables automatic upgrades to prevent disruptions
- Restarts Docker and Vast.ai services

### Quick usage

```bash
wget -O update_machine.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PKBO/vasttools/main/update_machine.sh
chmod +x update_machine.sh
./update_machine.sh

Requirements
Bash shell

Ubuntu or Debian-based system

Docker installed and working

Vast.ai service installed

Root or sudo privileges

Output
Status messages and logs printed directly to the terminal.

ðŸ“¦ Docker Usage Overview Script (docker_report.sh)
This script gives you an overview of space used by Docker containers, images, and build cache.

What the script does
Lists running containers (sorted by size)

Lists stopped containers (sorted by size)

Lists Docker images (sorted by size)

Shows total build cache size

Lists individual cache entries (sorted by size)

Quick usage
bash
ZkopÃ­rovat
Upravit
wget -O docker_report.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PKBO/vasttools/main/docker_report.sh
chmod +x docker_report.sh
./docker_report.sh
Requirements
Bash shell

Docker 19.03+ with docker builder df support

Output
Clean terminal output with sorted summaries of Docker space usage.

âš¡ Fast Reboot with GPU Reinitialization (kexec.sh)
This script allows a near-instant reboot of the system using kexec, without triggering BIOS/POST. This is especially useful when a GPU has "fallen off the PCIe bus" and needs to be re-initialized without full downtime.

What the script does
Automatically detects the newest installed kernel in /boot

Loads the kernel into memory with kexec -l

Immediately reboots into it using kexec -e

Reinitializes PCIe devices including GPUs

Skips BIOS, keeping network mostly online (especially important for Vast.ai)

Quick usage
bash
ZkopÃ­rovat
Upravit
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PKBO/vasttools/main/kexecinstall.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
Then run:

bash
ZkopÃ­rovat
Upravit
kxreboot
This triggers the fast reboot using the installed /usr/local/bin/safe-kexec.sh script.

Files in this repo
kexecinstall.sh â€“ Installer

kexec.sh â€“ Core reboot logic

Requirements
Bash shell

Ubuntu or Debian-based system

kexec-tools (installed automatically)

Root or sudo privileges

Output
Fast reboot with full PCIe reinitialization in 5â€“10 seconds. Vast.ai typically does not detect any downtime.
